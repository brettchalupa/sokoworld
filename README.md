# SokoWorld

Free and open source Sokoban client made with Rust and Macroquad.

[Play the game!](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/sokoworld)

Alternate install instructions:

- [Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/brettchalupa/sokoworld/releases)
- Install with Cargo if you have Rust installed: `cargo install sokoworld`

## Defining Levels

Levels are collected in Packs, which are
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) files that describe the pack and
the data for each level within it.

The benefit of using TOML is that it's much more human readable
than XML but provides a bit of structure and mark-up. It
strikes a nice balance of easy to map to data structures while
also being human editable.

See [level-format.txt](./level-format.txt) for the meaning of
characters in the level files.

## Dev Tools

In debug builds, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd> quits quickly.

### Play a Specific Level

Run a specific pack and level with:

```console
cargo run -- -p=assets/yoshio-murase-automatic.toml -l=2
```

where `-p=` is the path to the level pack and `-l=` is the number of level in the levels table.

### Reload the Current Level from Disk

Press the <kbd>9</kbd> key to reload the current level from disk. This is useful for iterating on the design of a level.

## Dev Notes

- the JS shims in web are explicitly checked in in case they disappear & to have versions match

## Deployment

The game is currently hosted on itch at https://brettchalupa.itch.io/sokoworld

### Web

WASM builds can be built and pushed by running:

```console
./release_wasm.sh
```

Ideally in the future this would push builds for desktop operating systems, create tags, etc., but this works for development.

### macOS

macOS uses [cargo bundle](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle):

1. Install cargo bundle: `cargo install cargo-bundle`
2. Build the bundle: `cargo bundle --release`

There's a `release_macos.sh` script to build and upload a Universal app for macOS (works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs).

### Windows

Not ideal but functioning

1. `cargo run --release`
2. `mkdir win`
3. `cp .\target\release\sokoworld.exe .\win\`
4. copy the assets folder into the `win` dir
5. zip it up
6. upload it to itch.io manually

### Linux

Run the script:

```console
./release_linux.sh
```
